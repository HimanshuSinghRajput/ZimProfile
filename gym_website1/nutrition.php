                                                <p>A healthy, well-balanced and nutritious diet is essential for good physical health and positive mental well-being. In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, our bodies require a variety of vitamins and minerals which we must obtain from the food that we eat.</p>

                                                <p>Eating a well-balanced diet can help you get the calories and nutrients you need to fuel your daily activities, including regular exercise. When it comes to eating foods to fuel your exercise performance, it’s not as simple as choosing vegetables over doughnuts. You need to get the right types of food at the right times of the day. Learn about the importance of healthy breakfasts, workout snacks, and meal plans. By eating a healthy, well-considered meal 1-2 hours before exercise, and another healthy, well-considered meal within 1-2 hours after exercise, most people can meet their workout nutrition needs without anything else.</p>
