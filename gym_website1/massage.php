                                                <p>As humans when we contemplate getting into shape we tend to think of exercise and diet as the main components to help us achieve our goals. While these are important, there are other things that contribute to a healthy body and mind; one of which is massage.</p>

                                            <div class="marB30">
                                                <p>Receiving a massage once you've finished working out helps reduce muscle soreness by reducing inflammation and reduces your recovery time by speeding up cell recovery. The key thing to bear in mind is that the massage should take place as soon as possible after exercising. According to a study in the Journal of Athletic Training this can reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMs) by a massive 30%. So there you have it. The answer is there are huge benefits to having a massage both before and after a workout, just be sure to get the right type of massage to set your body up for success.</p>

                                                <p>Getting a massage before working out allows the muscles to get warmed up and stretched out so you're more flexible. It also helps get you in the right frame of mind to work out.</p>
