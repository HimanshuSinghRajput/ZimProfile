                                                <p>Cardio exercise is any exercise that raises your heart rate. Face it our bodies were made to move. And we all know that to keep our muscles in shape we need move them. This movement makes them stronger and stronger muscles make for a more efficient and healthy body. </p>

                                                <p>Therefore working it makes it stronger. A stronger cardio-vascular system means more capillaries delivering more oxygen to cells in your muscles. This enables your cells to burn more fat during both exercise and inactivity.</p>

												"Walking – This is the easiest and safest way to start getting in your cardio.<br>
												Running –  This one is easy to understand. 
												<br>
												High Intensity Interval Training – Short intervals at maximum intensity followed by short periods of rest. 
 
												<br>
												Cycling – Cycling uses large muscle groups in the legs and helps elevate your heart rate. <br>
												Stair Climber – Uses more muscles than walking. <br>
												Jumping Rope –  Cheap, easy and burns tons of calories. <br>
												Circuit Training – When you work out at a high intensity the blood starts to pump a lot harder and that challenges the elasticity of the arterial wall."</b></p>
