												<br>
												1.Consuming at least 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. A high-protein diet is actually more beneficial when you're dieting than when you're not!
												<br>
												2.Carb-cycling: Following a low-to-moderate carb diet, with fewer carbs on non-training days, and a little more on training days.
												<br>
												3.Making sure you get lots of essential fatty acids (EFAs).
												<br>
												4.Having as little sugar as possible.
												<br>
												5.Stopping all carb consumption after 6 PM."</b></p>
