                                                <p>Weight gain is a serious problem. Most of the people are underweight. You can follow a healthy diet which is focused on weight gain. For the diet you can choose Daily Nutritional Diet who have a special diet plan dedicated to the problem of weight gain.</p>

                                                <p>You can gain a physique only if you eat correct and maitrium a diet. Gym is just 30% of the equation rest 70% to the core is diet. By diet I don't mean you starve but eat 6 times a day. Eat the right meals.</p>

                                                <p>Now, coming to your problems of weight lifting. The most important thing with weight lifting is that the shape and form should be maintained. If you can lift dumbbells of 4 kg with ease, so be it. Be confident enough of getting a good shape as you are not losing form. And for any kind of strength building exercises you will need to do lots of push-ups and pull ups, coz that's where the real power comes from. Then you should also do dead lifts . Dead lifts can be done for any body part, you just have to get the heaviest weight you can lift and just keep holding it that way. </p>
